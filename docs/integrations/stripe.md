# Stripe

Payments. Checkout is fully built: `backend/src/checkout.ts::priceCheckout()`
prices every cart server-side from `packages/shared/src/commerce.ts` and hands
Stripe **inline `price_data`** per line item — there is no persistent Stripe
Product/Price catalogue to manage, even with 8 frame color variants, since the
price is computed fresh per request rather than looked up by a price ID.

## Env vars

| Var | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | backend | `sk_test_…` in dev. Never reaches the client. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | backend | `whsec_…`. Verifies the webhook signature. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | frontend | `pk_test_…`. Safe to expose; used by Stripe.js at checkout (not wired yet). |

Test keys: <https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys>. Stay in **test mode**.

## Where the code lives

- `backend/src/stripe.ts` — lazy, env-guarded client (`getStripe()` returns `null`
  when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset), `isConfigured()`, and `constructWebhookEvent()`.
- `backend/src/app.ts` → `registerRoutes()` — `POST /webhooks/stripe` and the
  `stripe` field of `GET /health/integrations`.
- Order/payment types that the frontend will read go in `packages/shared/src/index.ts`.

## Webhooks

The single biggest footgun: **signature verification needs the raw, unparsed request
body.** Do not `JSON.parse` before verifying. The handler reads `await c.req.text()`
and the `stripe-signature` header, then calls `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(raw,
sig, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)`. A bad/missing signature → `400`. The route is mounted at
both `/webhooks/stripe` and `/_/backend/webhooks/stripe` (Vercel does not strip the
service prefix — see `app.ts`).

### Local webhook loop (Stripe CLI)

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8787/webhooks/stripe   # prints whsec_… → STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded                       # fire a test event
```

## Gotchas

- Raw body for signatures (above). Amounts are in the **smallest currency unit**
  (pence/cents), integers. Make every mutation **idempotent** (Stripe retries
  webhooks; use the event `id`). Treat `payment_intent.succeeded` (or
  `checkout.session.completed`) as the source of truth for "paid", never the client.

## Verify

```bash
pnpm --filter @pinprint/backend test       # hermetic signature accept/reject (backend/src/stripe.test.ts)
curl -s localhost:8787/health/integrations  # { "stripe": true|false, ... }
curl -i -X POST localhost:8787/webhooks/stripe   # no signature → 400
```

## MCP

The Stripe MCP server is in `.mcp.json` (`npx @stripe/mcp`, reads `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).
It can inspect test-mode objects and search Stripe docs from the agent session.

## Go-live checklist

Everything above is built and verified in **test mode**. These are the
remaining steps — all user-executed, none of them a code change — before
real checkout can accept a real card. Do them in this order:

1. **Register the live webhook endpoint.** Stripe dashboard → Developers →
   Webhooks → Add endpoint → `https://<your-domain>/webhooks/stripe` (or the
   Vercel-issued domain if a custom one isn't set up yet — see CLAUDE.md's
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` TODO). Subscribe at least to
   `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
   `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.refunded`, `checkout.session.expired`,
   and `charge.dispute.created` (the events `backend/src/webhooks.ts::
   handleStripeEvent` switches on). Copy the endpoint's signing secret.
2. **Add the live keys to Vercel Production**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (`sk_live_…`),
   `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (the `whsec_…` from step 1). **This is currently
   missing** — verified 2026-07-03 via `vercel env ls production`; every
   webhook delivery 400s until it's set (see CLAUDE.md's Pre-launch TODO).
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` isn't actually used yet (Checkout is
   server-redirected, not Stripe.js-embedded) — skip it unless that changes.
3. **No product/price migration needed.** Since pricing is dynamic
   `price_data`, there's nothing to "promote" from test to live mode — the
   same code path just starts hitting Stripe's live API once the key changes.
4. **Run one real test-card purchase against the live-configured deploy**
   before announcing launch, including a framed variant — confirm the order
   reaches `paid`, a `fulfillments` row appears, and the digital-delivery
   email sends. (Once real, immediately also flip `ARTELO_TEST_ORDERS` to
   `false` in Vercel — see docs/integrations/artelo.md — or Stripe will
   charge real money for orders Artelo silently never produces.)
5. **Revert to test mode is just as easy**: swap the keys back. Nothing else
   depends on which mode is active.
