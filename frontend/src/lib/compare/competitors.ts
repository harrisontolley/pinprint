// Data for the "Heartbound Maps vs [Competitor]" comparison pages. One Competitor entry
// per page; the route, table and layout render straight from these.
//
// TRUTHFULNESS RULES (see plan):
//  - Every competitor claim is sourced from their live site as of `lastReviewed`.
//    Where a figure could not be verified (e.g. prices locked in a JS editor) the
//    copy stays qualitative rather than inventing a number.
//  - Heartbound Maps's own prices come from HEARTBOUND_FACTS (derived from the canonical
//    commerce catalogue) so they can't drift — never hardcode them here.
//  - Heartbound Maps ships US-only (do NOT claim "40+ countries"), and we do NOT assert a
//    specific number of styles (the engine ships more than the landing advertises);
//    say "multiple styles" instead.
//  - Honest but favorable: concede genuine competitor strengths in whoFits.competitor
//    and the shipping/pricing sections; win on real differentiators.
