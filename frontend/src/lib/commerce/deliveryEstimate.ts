// "made and shipped within 2 to 3 business days, and arrives within 5 to 10
// business days total"). These two constants are the single source for that
// prose; the FAQ text itself stays hand-written (it's covered by the copy
// voice-rule tests), but a comment there points back here.

// Every rendered string built from this module must read as an estimate,
// never a promise: "arrives", never "will arrive" or "guaranteed by".
//
// Date-only math, done in UTC. All call sites are "use client" components
// that compute a fresh `now` on the client after mount (see useHydrated
// elsewhere in the codebase) — never during server render — so the same
// visitor never sees a server-computed date disagree with their own clock,
// and static pages never bake in a date at build time. On top of the
// self-declared max-transit figure we add one extra conservative buffer day
// (BUFFER_BUSINESS_DAYS below) before treating a date as the "latest" bound,
// since this is pure estimate math with no carrier confirmation behind it.
